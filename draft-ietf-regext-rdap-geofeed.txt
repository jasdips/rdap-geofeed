                   An RDAP Extension for Geofeed Data
                   draft-ietf-regext-rdap-geofeed-05

Abstract

   This document defines a new Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
   extension, "geofeed1", for indicating that an RDAP server hosts
   geofeed URLs for its IP network objects.  It also defines a new media
   type and link relation type for the associated link objects included
   in responses.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8805] and [I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] (obsoletes [RFC9092])
   detail the IP geolocation feed (commonly known as 'geofeed') file
   format and associated access mechanisms.  This document specifies how
   geofeed URLs can be accessed through RDAP.  It defines a new RDAP
   extension, "geofeed1", for indicating that an RDAP server hosts
   geofeed URLs for its IP networks, as well as a media type and a link
   relation type for the associated link objects.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of
   this protocol.

2.  Specification

2.1.  Media Type for a Geofeed Link

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] requires a geofeed file to be a UTF-8
   [RFC3629] comma-separated values (CSV) file, with a series of "#"
   comments at the end for the optional Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI, [RFC6480]) signature.  At first glance, the
   "text/csv" media type (Section 4 of [I-D.shafranovich-rfc4180-bis])
   seems like a good candidate for a geofeed file, since it supports the
   "#" comments needed for including the RPKI signature.

   However, although the CSV geofeed data could be viewed directly by a
   user such that the "text/csv" media type was appropriate, the most
   common use case will involve it being processed by some sort of
   application first, in order to facilitate subsequent address lookup
   operations.  Therefore, using a new "application" media type with a
   "geofeed" subtype (Section 4.2.5 of [RFC6838]) for the geofeed data
   is preferable to using "text/csv".

   To that end, this document registers a new "application/geofeed+csv"
   media type in the IANA Media Types Registry (see Section 5.3), and a
   new "+csv" suffix in the IANA Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry
   (see Section 5.4).

2.2.  Geofeed Link

   An RDAP server that hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects
   (Section 5.4 of [RFC9083]) may include link objects for those geofeed
   URLs in IP network objects in its responses.  These link objects are
   added to the "links" member of each object (Section 4.2 of
   [RFC9083]).

   In RDAP, the "value", "rel", and "href" JSON members are REQUIRED for
   any link object.  Additionally, for a geofeed link object, the "type"
   JSON member is RECOMMENDED.  The geofeed-specific components of a
   link object are like so:

   *  "rel" -- The link relation type is set to "geo".  This is a new
      link relation type for geographical data, registered in the IANA
      Link Relations Registry (see Section 5.2) by this document.
   *  "href" -- The target URL is set to the HTTPS URL of the geofeed
      file for an IP network.
   *  "type" -- "application/geofeed+csv" (see Section 2.1).

Internet-Draft                rdap-geofeed                    April 2024


   An IP network object returned by an RDAP server may contain zero,
   one, or multiple geofeed link objects.  An example scenario where
   more than one geofeed link object would be returned is where the
   server is able to represent that data in multiple languages (see the
   "hreflang" member of the link object).

2.3.  Extension Identifier

   An RDAP server that returns geofeed link objects in accordance with
   this specification is RECOMMENDED to include the "geofeed1" extension
   identifier in the "rdapConformance" array for any lookup or search
   response containing an IP network object, as well as in the help
   response.  Here is an elided example for this inclusion:

   {
       "rdapConformance": [ "rdap_level_0", "geofeed1", ... ],
       ...
   }

   Extension identifier inclusion is not mandatory, because RDAP does
   not require that an extension identifier be included in responses
   merely to make use of new media types or link relation types.  An
   RDAP server that includes the "geofeed1" identifier is signalling to
   clients that it hosts geofeed URLs and will return those URLs in
   accordance with this specification where they are available.  The
   main benefit of including the identifier is that it permits a client
   to determine that a server does host geofeed URLs, which is useful
   where a client receives an IP network object without a geofeed URL,
   for example.

   Although a server may use registered media types in its link objects
   without any restrictions, it may be useful to define new RDAP
   extensions for those media types in order for the server to
   communicate to clients that it will make data for that type
   accessible, in the same way that the server does with the "geofeed1"
   extension identifier.

2.4.  Example

   The following is an elided example of an IP network object with a
   geofeed link object:

           },
           ...
       ],
       ...
   }

3.  Privacy Considerations

   When including a geofeed file URL in an IP Network object, an RDAP
   server operator SHOULD follow the guidance from Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] to not accidentally expose the location
   of an individual.

   Many jurisdictions have laws or regulations that restrict the use of
   "personal data", per the definition in [RFC6973].  Given that,
   registry operators should ascertain whether the regulatory
   environment in which they operate permits implementation of the
   functionality defined in this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] requires an HTTPS URL for a geofeed
   file.  The geofeed file may also contain an RPKI signature.  Besides
   that, this document does not introduce any new security
   considerations past those already discussed in the RDAP protocol
   specifications.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Mark Kosters provided initial support and encouragement for this
   work, along with the [RFC9092] authors.  Gavin Brown suggested using
   a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a geofeed file
   URL.  Andy Newton, James Gould, and Scott Hollenbeck also provided
   valuable feedback for this document.

7.  Change History

7.1.  Changes from 00 to 01

   *  Now using a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a
      geofeed file URL.
   *  Renamed the extension as "geofeed1" instead of "geofeedv1".
   *  Introduced the new "geo" link relation type.
   *  Introduced the new "application/geofeed+csv" media type.

7.2.  Changes from 01 to 02

   *  Updated the "Requirements Language" section for examples.
   *  Added an example for RDAP conformance.
   *  Updated the rationale for using the new "application/geofeed+csv"
      media type.
   *  Updated the "Applications that use this media type" section for
      the "application/geofeed+csv" registration.

7.3.  Changes from 02 to 03

   *  Removed "value" and "hreflang" explanations from the "Geofeed
      Link" section.  Further, clarified the cardinality of geofeed link
      objects.
   *  Updated extensibility verbiage in the "Media Type for a Geofeed
      Link" section.
   *  In the "Example" section, updated the domain in "href" of the
      geofeed link object to contrast with the domain in "value" to
      highlight that "href" is for a geofeed file hosted at a network
      operator site whereas "value" is for an IP network object from an
      RDAP server.
   *  Removed the "Redaction" section since the geofeed files are public
      to start with.
   *  Added URLs for various IANA registries.

7.4.  Changes from 03 to 04
