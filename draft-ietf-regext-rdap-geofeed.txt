1.  Introduction

   [RFC8805] and [RFC9632] detail the IP geolocation feed (commonly
   known as 'geofeed') file format and associated access mechanisms.
   This document specifies how geofeed URLs can be accessed through
   RDAP.  It defines a new RDAP extension, "geofeed1", for indicating
   that an RDAP server hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects, as
   well as a media type and a link relation type for the associated link
   objects.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of
   this protocol.

   "..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside
   of this document.

2.  Specification

2.1.  Media Type for a Geofeed Link

   [RFC9632] requires a geofeed file to be a UTF-8 [RFC3629] comma-
   separated values (CSV) file, with a series of "#" comments at the end
   for the optional Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI, [RFC6480])
   signature.  At first glance, the "text/csv" media type (Section 4 of
   [I-D.shafranovich-rfc4180-bis]) seems like a good candidate for a
   geofeed file, since it supports the "#" comments needed for including
   the RPKI signature.

   However, although the CSV geofeed data could be viewed directly by a
   user such that the "text/csv" media type was appropriate, the most
   common use case will involve it being processed by some sort of
   application first, in order to facilitate subsequent address lookup
   operations.  Therefore, using a new "application" media type with a
   "geofeed" subtype (Section 4.2.5 of [RFC6838]) for the geofeed data
   is preferable to using "text/csv".

   To that end, this document registers a new "application/geofeed+csv"
   media type in the IANA Media Types Registry (see Section 6.3), and a
   new "+csv" suffix in the IANA Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry
   (see Section 6.4).

2.2.  Geofeed Link

   An RDAP server that hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects
   (Section 5.4 of [RFC9083]) may include link objects for those geofeed
   URLs in IP network objects in its responses.  These link objects are
   added to the "links" member of each object (Section 4.2 of
   [RFC9083]).

Internet-Draft                rdap-geofeed                  October 2024


   In RDAP, the "value", "rel", and "href" JSON members are REQUIRED for
   any link object.  Additionally, for a geofeed link object, the "type"
   JSON member is RECOMMENDED.  The geofeed-specific components of a
   link object are like so:

   *  "rel" -- The link relation type is set to "geo".  This is a new
      link relation type for geographical data, registered in the IANA
      Link Relations Registry (see Section 6.2) by this document.
   *  "href" -- The target URL is set to the HTTPS URL of the geofeed
      file for an IP network.
   *  "type" -- "application/geofeed+csv" (see Section 2.1).

   An IP network object returned by an RDAP server may contain zero,
   one, or multiple geofeed link objects.  An example scenario where
   more than one geofeed link object would be returned is where the
   server is able to represent that data in multiple languages (see the
   "hreflang" member of the link object).

2.3.  Extension Identifier

   This document defines a new extension identifier, "geofeed1", for use
   by servers that host geofeed URLs for their IP network objects and
   include geofeed URL link objects in their responses to clients in
   accordance with Section 2.2.  A server that uses this extension
   identifier MUST include it in the "rdapConformance" array for any
   lookup or search response containing an IP network object, as well as
   in the help response.  Here is an elided example for this inclusion:

   {
       "rdapConformance": [ "rdap_level_0", "geofeed1", ... ],
       ...
   }

   An RDAP server may make use of the "application/geofeed+csv" media
   type and the "geo" link relation defined in this specification in its
   responses without including the "geofeed1" extension identifier in
   those responses, because RDAP servers are free to use any registered
   media type or link relation in a standard response (without
   implementing any particular extension).  The additional value of the
   extension identifier here is that it signals to the client that the
   server hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects.  This is useful
   where a client receives an IP network object without a geofeed link
   object, because in that case the client can infer that no geofeed
   data is available for that object, since the server would have
   provided it if it were available.

   Although a server may use registered media types in its link objects
   without any restrictions, it may be useful to define new RDAP
   extensions for those media types in order for the server to
   communicate to clients that it will make data for that type
   accessible, in the same way that the server does with the "geofeed1"
   extension identifier.

2.4.  Example

   The following is an elided example of an IP network object with a
   geofeed link object:

   {
       "objectClassName": "ip network",
       "handle": "XXXX-RIR",
       "startAddress": "2001:db8::",
       "endAddress": "2001:db8:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff",
       "ipVersion": "v6",
       "name": "NET-RTR-1",
       "type": "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
       "country": "AU",
       "parentHandle": "YYYY-RIR",
       "status": [ "active" ],
       "links":
        [
           {
               "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
               "rel": "self",
               "href": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
               "type": "application/rdap+json"
           },
           {
               "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
               "rel": "geo",
               "href": "https://example.com/geofeed",
               "type": "application/geofeed+csv"
           },
           ...
       ],
       ...
   }

3.  Operational Considerations

   When an RDAP server is queried for an IP network for a given address
   range, it is required to return the most-specific IP network object
   that covers the address range.  That IP network object may not have
   an associated geofeed link, but it is possible that a less-specific
   IP network object does have such a link.  Clients attempting to
   retrieve geofeed data for a given address range via RDAP should
   consider whether to retrieve the parent object for the initial
   response (and so on, recursively) in the event that the initial
   response does not contain geofeed data.  Conversely, server operators
   should consider interface options for resource holders in order to
   support the provisioning of geofeed links for all networks covered by
   the associated data.

   It is common for a resource holder to maintain a single geofeed file
   containing the geofeed data for all of their resources.  The resource
   holder then updates each of their network object registrations to
   refer to that single geofeed file.  As with geofeed references in
   inetnum objects (per [RFC9632]), clients who find a geofeed link
   object within an IP network object MUST ignore geofeed data from that
   link that is outside the IP network object's address range.

   Section 3.2 of [RFC8805] recommends that consumers of geofeed data
   verify that the publisher of the data is authoritative for the
   relevant resources.  The RDAP bootstrap process ([RFC9224]) helps
   clients with this recommendation, since a client following that
   process will be directed to the RDAP server that is able to make
   authoritative statements about the disposition of the relevant
   resources.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   When including a geofeed file URL in an IP network object, it is
   expected that the service provider publishing the geofeed file has
   followed the guidance from Section 7 of [RFC9632] to not accidentally
   expose the location of an individual.

   Many jurisdictions have laws or regulations that restrict the use of
   "personal data", per the definition in [RFC6973].  Given that,
   registry operators should ascertain whether the regulatory
   environment in which they operate permits implementation of the
   functionality defined in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   [RFC9632] requires an HTTPS URL for a geofeed file.  The geofeed file
   may also contain an RPKI signature.  Besides that, this document does
   not introduce any new security considerations past those already
   discussed in the RDAP protocol specifications.

9.1.  Changes from 00 to 01

   *  Now using a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a
      geofeed file URL.
   *  Renamed the extension as "geofeed1" instead of "geofeedv1".
   *  Introduced the new "geo" link relation type.
   *  Introduced the new "application/geofeed+csv" media type.

9.2.  Changes from 01 to 02

   *  Updated the "Requirements Language" section for examples.
   *  Added an example for RDAP conformance.
   *  Updated the rationale for using the new "application/geofeed+csv"
      media type.
   *  Updated the "Applications that use this media type" section for
      the "application/geofeed+csv" registration.

9.3.  Changes from 02 to 03
