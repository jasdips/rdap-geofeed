.# Abstract

This document defines a new Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
extension, "geofeed1", for indicating that an RDAP server hosts
geofeed URLs for its IP network objects.  It also defines a new media
type and link relation type for the associated link objects included
in responses.

# Introduction

[@!RFC8805] and [@?I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] (obsoletes
[@!RFC9092]) detail the IP geolocation feed (commonly known as
'geofeed') file format and associated access mechanisms. This document
specifies how geofeed URLs can be accessed through RDAP. It defines a
new RDAP extension, "geofeed1", for indicating that an RDAP server
hosts geofeed URLs for its IP networks, as well as a media type and a
link relation type for the associated link objects.

## Requirements Language

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to illustrate
element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of this
protocol.

"..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside of
this document.

# Specification

## Media Type for a Geofeed Link {#media_type_for_a_geofeed_link}

[@?I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] requires a geofeed file to be a UTF-8
[@!RFC3629] comma-separated values (CSV) file, with a series of "#"
comments at the end for the optional Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI, [@!RFC6480]) signature. At first glance, the
"text/csv" media type ([@?I-D.shafranovich-rfc4180-bis, section 4])
seems like a good candidate for a geofeed file, since it supports the
"#" comments needed for including the RPKI signature.

However, although the CSV geofeed data could be viewed directly by a
user such that the "text/csv" media type was appropriate, the most
common use case will involve it being processed by some sort of
application first, in order to facilitate subsequent address lookup
operations.  Therefore, using a new "application" media type with a
"geofeed" subtype ([@!RFC6838, section 4.2.5]) for the geofeed data is
preferable to using "text/csv".

To that end, this document registers a new "application/geofeed+csv"
media type in the IANA Media Types Registry (see
(#media_types_registry)), and a new "+csv" suffix in the IANA
Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry (see
(#structured_syntax_suffixes_registry)).

## Geofeed Link

An RDAP server that hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects
([@!RFC9083, section 5.4]) may include link objects for those geofeed
URLs in IP network objects in its responses.  These link objects are
added to the "links" member of each object ([@!RFC9083, section 4.2]).

In RDAP, the "value", "rel", and "href" JSON members are REQUIRED for
any link object.  Additionally, for a geofeed link object, the "type"
JSON member is RECOMMENDED.  The geofeed-specific components of a link
object are like so:

* "rel" -- The link relation type is set to "geo". This is a new link
  relation type for geographical data, registered
  in the IANA Link Relations Registry (see (#link_relations_registry))
  by this document.
* "href" -- The target URL is set to the HTTPS URL of the geofeed
  file for an IP network.
* "type" -- "application/geofeed+csv" (see (#media_type_for_a_geofeed_link)).

An IP network object returned by an RDAP server may contain zero, one,
or multiple geofeed link objects.  An example scenario where more than
one geofeed link object would be returned is where the server is able
to represent that data in multiple languages (see the "hreflang"
member of the link object).

## Extension Identifier

An RDAP server that returns geofeed link objects in accordance with
this specification is RECOMMENDED to include the "geofeed1" extension
identifier in the "rdapConformance" array for any lookup or search
response containing an IP network object, as well as in the help
response. Here is an elided example for this inclusion:

```
{
    "rdapConformance": [ "rdap_level_0", "geofeed1", ... ],
    ...
}
```

Extension identifier inclusion is not mandatory, because RDAP does not
require that an extension identifier be included in responses merely
to make use of new media types or link relation types.  An RDAP server
that includes the "geofeed1" identifier is signalling to clients that
it hosts geofeed URLs and will return those URLs in accordance with
this specification where they are available.  The main benefit of
including the identifier is that it permits a client to determine that
a server does host geofeed URLs, which is useful where a client
receives an IP network object without a geofeed URL, for example.

Although a server may use registered media types in its link objects
without any restrictions, it may be useful to define new RDAP
extensions for those media types in order for the server to
communicate to clients that it will make data for that type
accessible, in the same way that the server does with the "geofeed1"
extension identifier.

## Example

The following is an elided example of an IP network object with a
geofeed link object:

```
{
    "objectClassName": "ip network",
    "handle": "XXXX-RIR",
    "startAddress": "2001:db8::",
    "endAddress": "2001:db8:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff",
    "ipVersion": "v6",
    "name": "NET-RTR-1",
    "type": "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
    "country": "AU",
    "parentHandle": "YYYY-RIR",
    "status": [ "active" ],
    "links":
     [
        {
            "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
            "type": "application/rdap+json"
        },
        {
            "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
            "rel": "geo",
            "href": "https://example.com/geofeed",
            "type": "application/geofeed+csv"
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

# Privacy Considerations

When including a geofeed file URL in an IP Network object, an RDAP
server operator SHOULD follow the guidance from
[@?I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update, section 7] to not accidentally expose
the location of an individual.

Many jurisdictions have laws or regulations that restrict the use of
"personal data", per the definition in [@!RFC6973].  Given that,
registry operators should ascertain whether the regulatory environment
in which they operate permits implementation of the functionality
defined in this document.

# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

[@?I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update] requires an HTTPS URL for a geofeed
file.  The geofeed file may also contain an RPKI signature.  Besides
that, this document does not introduce any new security considerations
past those already discussed in the RDAP protocol specifications.

# IANA Considerations

# Acknowledgements

Mark Kosters provided initial support and encouragement for this work, along with the [@!RFC9092] authors. Gavin Brown
suggested using a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a geofeed file URL. Andy Newton, James Gould, and
Scott Hollenbeck also provided valuable feedback for this document.

# Change History

## Changes from 00 to 01

* Now using a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a geofeed file URL.
* Renamed the extension as "geofeed1" instead of "geofeedv1".
* Introduced the new "geo" link relation type.
* Introduced the new "application/geofeed+csv" media type.

## Changes from 01 to 02

* Updated the "Requirements Language" section for examples.
* Added an example for RDAP conformance.
* Updated the rationale for using the new "application/geofeed+csv" media type.
* Updated the "Applications that use this media type" section for the "application/geofeed+csv" registration.

## Changes from 02 to 03

* Removed "value" and "hreflang" explanations from the "Geofeed Link" section. Further, clarified the cardinality of
  geofeed link objects.
* Updated extensibility verbiage in the "Media Type for a Geofeed Link" section.
* In the "Example" section, updated the domain in "href" of the geofeed link object to contrast with the domain in
  "value" to highlight that "href" is for a geofeed file hosted at a network operator site whereas "value" is for an IP
  network object from an RDAP server.
* Removed the "Redaction" section since the geofeed files are public to start with.
